                            <p><b> Everyone talks about pornography but only a few understand how children are suffering from these issues. Don’t worry our agencies are now 100% capable to tackle and eliminate child pornography. Let’s continue this healthy reading.</b>
                                <br><br><b>Pornography</b> means the depiction of any content, whether printed or visual, that contains manifest narration, demonstration, or display of sexual activities, sexual organs, or any other obscene material with an intention to trigger the sexual excitement of the viewers. We call it child pornography when <b>children</b> are involved in these types of activities. It’s like a horror dream for children & victims.                                
                                <br><br><b>Child pornography</b> promotes and encourages exploitation, trafficking, and violence towards children. This is the reason why child pornography is considered a heinous crime.
                                <br><br>Everyone around the globe has access to the Internet. It has become so simple and easy for people to gain access to child pornography, and unfortunately, the exchange of this type of content has reached its maximum. This has allowed a considerable increase in the production of child pornography. Some photographs that were secretly taken by criminals without their consent are mostly used in these heinous crimes. Criminals are able to exchange these child pornographic materials with each other, advices are also exchanged on their evil practice. There are forums and chats (especially <b>Telegram, Signal and WhatsApp</b> are a hub of these types of contents) where information and files are exchanged on how to commit these crimes without leaving any evidence.

                                <br><img src="assets/images/reasons.png">
                                <br><br><br><br><h2 class="post-tile" style="text-align: center;">Impact of child pornography:</h2>
                                <br><h3 class="post-title">POCSO Act</h3> 
                                To combat child sexual abuse cases, the Indian Government has brought in a special law, named, <b>The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act</b>. This act is enacted for protecting Children’s under the special law,<b> Section 13, Section 14 and Section 15</b>.
                                <br><br><h3 class="post-title">Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Information Technology Act, 2000</h3>
                                Indian Penal Code does not deal with child pornography directly, but it prohibits the display of obscene material to young persons. The <b>Section 293 and Section 67B of the IT Act</b> punishes the act of <b>publishing, transmitting, creating, collecting, browsing, downloading, advertising, promoting, exchanging, distributing, recording, etc.</b> of any material in electronic form which shows sexually explicit activity engaging a child.
                                <br><br><br><h2 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">Some Action by Agencies and Non Gov Groups </h2>
                                <br><b>Operation P Hunt</b> an operation against online child sex offenders in Kerala is part of, who is accused of digitally circulating, storing, viewing, and sharing child sexual abuse material. Under IPS Manoj Abraham sir leadership Kerala Cyberdome Police got massive success where he arrested many criminals, seized many devices and saved victims from these heinous crimes.
                                <br><br>Delhi Police under CP Rakesh Asthana sir leadership also cracked many cases and arrested many criminals who were involved in child pornography activity.
                                <br><br>Every day many arrests took place against child pornography by Assam Police and UP Police under the leadership of IPS GP Singh and IPS Triveni Singh sir.
                                <br><br><b>Central Bureau of Investigation</b> also conducted massive raids across 77 locations arrested many groups and individuals and helped many victims.
                                <br><br>Some Indian Hackers groups also took stand against Child Pornography by hacking and taking down these sites, launched many operations, and eliminated many accounts and groups across many social media platforms.
                                <br><br><br><h2 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">How to tackle Child Pornography</h2>
                                <br><ul>
                                    <li>Make healthcare accessible to children</li>
                                    <li>Promote healthy habits</li>
                                    <li>Limit screen time</li>
                                    <li>Digital monitoring and check-ups</li>
                                    <li>Awareness</li>
                                    <li>Proper support </li>
                                    <li>Friendly behaviour with children</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br><br><br><h2 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
                                <br>The offense of child pornography is not just one offense, rather it is a series of offenses. It begins with the sexual abuse of a child who probably doesn’t even understand what is happening with him/her. Children are like Clay, we all are responsible for their good & bad. Making joke of Law Enforcement Agencies is easy but working like them for public welfare is impossible. I salute all the agencies for their commendable work without their support our safety is impossible. Jai Hind.
                                </p>
